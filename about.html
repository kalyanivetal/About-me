							<p>Being a Computer Science Student,My Intrests are Problem Solving and Learning new things that Came into Picture. Being a computer Science student I never Thought that i will Be doing my MCA from Pune University.After Reaching here i Got to Know that there are many things to Explore in Pune than that place where i was previously studying. The More you Explore yourself the more you learn. </p>
							<p>When I started learning new things while going through it sometimes I dont like it or i don't want to go through it but later when I get more into it I found it intesting and like to go deep into it. Thats how I explore the new things :)</p>
							<p>The thing which i always use to tell  my self is that "Time Heals almost Everything.." It Does...</p>
